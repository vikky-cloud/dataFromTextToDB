This project helps to import the data from .txt file to MySQL Database.

if you are using MySql database, make sure to import dependencies, the command is:
    pip install mysql-connector-python

Also make sure that your are connected to the database, to perform the operations. to know if you are connected to your database or not, fill the config run this below code:

    import mysql.connector

    config = {
        'user': 'db_username',
        'password': 'db_password',
        'host': 'db_localhost',
        'port': db_port.no,
        'database': 'db_name'
    }

    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(**config)
        print("Connection successful!")
    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        print(f"Error: {err}")


if you are using databases other than MySQL, please find the import of database connection from google and install their dependencies to run the application.
